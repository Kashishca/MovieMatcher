# MovieMatcher

**MovieMatcher** is a recommendation system that suggests movies based on user preferences using natural language processing techniques. The system employs the Bag-of-Words model to analyze movie descriptions and recommend films with similar content.

## Overview

MovieMatcher leverages the Bag-of-Words model and cosine similarity to recommend movies based on a user's input. It analyzes movie plot descriptions and compares them to suggest films that match the user's tastes.

## Features
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on movie descriptions using the Bag-of-Words technique.
- **Efficient Search**: Implements cosine similarity to quickly identify and recommend relevant movies.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple to use and highly effective in delivering personalized movie recommendations.

## Getting Started

To get started with MovieMatcher, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn

### Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MovieMatcher.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd MovieMatcher
    ```
3. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the project:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## How it Works

MovieMatcher uses the following steps to generate movie recommendations:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and processes movie data, converting plot descriptions into numerical vectors using the Bag-of-Words model.
2. **Cosine Similarity**: Computes the cosine similarity between the user's selected movie and other movies in the dataset to find similar films.
3. **Recommendation**: Suggests movies with the highest similarity score to the input movie.
